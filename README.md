A simple WPF app for managing your windows hosts file.


Do you ever get fed up of managing your windows host file manually?

You know what I mean, adding all those local dev based addresses to pretend you have a real site for the browser, or all those long lists of anoying scareware & popup sites that you've blocked.

Well, I got fed up of it too, so I wrote this, and now I'm letting you have it if you want, warts and all

It has 3 main functions.

1) It allows you to keep different collections of host lists and quickly switch between them
2) It allows you to edit said lists and add/remove entries from them
3) It allows you to import/export your lists to/from others so you can share lists of IP's to block easily

More to come (possibly) as the app develops, a big thanks to Gavin Lanata for the UI work :-)
